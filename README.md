# barrel_anatomy_WCR

Code for Taro Kiritani and Hesam Setareh's project on the anatomical and WCR data in the mouse barrel cortex. We first analyze the data Taro Kiritani acquired in [Petersen Lab](http://lsens.epfl.ch/) at [Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne](http://www.epfl.ch/), Switzerland. Then, we aim to build a computational model of the barrel cortex.
